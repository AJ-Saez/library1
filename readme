For this project called LA LIBRERIA we made its structuring in HTML, CSS and JS codes. 

 

Its structure was divided into parts called: 

 

        Body—header – Menu – Cards – Form – Footer  

 

The main colors used on which I base myself were the following; 

        #E37C02;    -             gray 

 

   aqua #00FFFF                    black: #000000; 

 

 

 

The type of calligraphy used were as follows;  

 

   font-family: 'Open inter', sans-serif; 

   font-family::'Proza Libre', sans-serif; 

 

 

                                           

 

The images used were placed on the web and used to make the promotions of a bookstore that places you by name:  

https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=search+terms&maxResults=39
